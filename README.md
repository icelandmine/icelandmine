I come from the land of cold, volcanos and hot springs. Tiny place, breathtaking and different.

Not a developer, rather I am a user of what they produce. Specially after the last financial crash interested in blockchain since it hit us hard and we are greatly setuped and prepared for this with clean enery. So really have been involved as a small scale miner in the space and recently as a staker since it is more efficient - and we need to look after our herritage, nowhere is it more apparent with such a rich history than here.

Expect me to hang around the blockchain space and bug the devs...
